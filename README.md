# CONTENT BASED MOVIE RECOMMENDER SYSTEM
In this project, I built a content based movie recommender systems for a collection of movies in the “The Movie Data Base” (tmdb_5000_movies) dataset downloaded from kaggle. This project is basically a Natural Language Processing (NLP) project in that the description field of the movie dataset was used to determine the similarity between all pairs of movies in the dataset. The Term Frequency - Inverse Document Frequency (TF-IDF) approach was used to vectorize the text documents while the cosine similarity matrix was used to quantify the similarity between each pair of movies. Finally, a function was written to take in a movie title and return 20 most similar movie to that movie. Hence, when a user indicates interest in a movie, 20 other movies can be recommended to the user. This recommendation can be through email marketing or the system could be built into various types of web applications to efficiently target users with smart recommendations.
